# deploying-software-project
Demonstrate creating a web application and deploying on the web.

The application just returns basic HTML but runs test on an API call and runs unit test on the app to deploy on to ECS Container on AWS.

# Learning Outcome:
Describe a behavior with gherkin 

Write unit test to test functions

Write a docker file to build image of my application

Write functional tests that test my feature, which is an API call

Utilize GitHub actions when on push, build, run unit tests, and push image to ECR on AWS

Practice continuous deployment pipeline structure
